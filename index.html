        <h2>Junior in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a junior at Bob Jones University studying Business Administration with a concentration in Human Resources.</p>
         <p>
            I am an active member of my society, and I have filled both the Sargent at Arms and Historian positions in my society officer crew for the last year.
         </p> 
         <p> 
             I worked at two Chick-fil-A's in Florida where my family lives and the Chick-fil-A in Greer, SC for a total of 5 years. I unfortunately had to quit my job last year because I was diagnosed with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), which causes occasional fainting spells, tachycardia, and chronic pain.
         </p>
         <p>
            When I'm not in class, I spend my time reading, writing, and napping because of chronic fatigue.
